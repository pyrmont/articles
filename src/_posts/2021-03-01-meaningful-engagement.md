With 2014 commencing and my 20s rapidly receding in the rear-view mirror of
personal history, I’ve decided that I want to spend more time in meaningful
engagement.

I am using _meaningful engagement_ to mean the spending of non-work time in a
manner that results in long-term value. _Value_ in this case is an intentionally
broad term that can mean everything from physical health to mental acuity, from
self-knowledge to expertise. Since it is _long-term_, it will typically require
sustained action. It could take the form of studying more, exercising longer,
eating well or sleeping better.

As is often the case with these sorts of resolutions, it is mostly defined (at
least for me personally) by what it is not.

Now, first: I am not a doctor. Or a psychologist.

Nevertheless, sometimes you have to make decisions and, generally when making
decisions, I try to make them from some sort of rational position. Just as the
material age of plenty provides us with numerous opportunities to eat more and
exert ourselves less (with [horrible consequences][diabetes]), our information
age of plenty provides us with a dizzying array of ways in which to alleviate
boredom.  What are the consequences of this?

I have a daily circuit of blogs overflowing with opinions on the latest in
politics, foreign affairs, technology and software. Having spent the past 7
years since graduation sucking at this teat, I reflected last year on what
little I had to show for it.

For all the time spent with blog post after Hacker News-linked blog post, I
still:

1. have read almost no literary fiction;
2. know precious little about important philosophers;
3. don’t understand much in the way of economics;
4. have a truly poor understanding of statistics; and
5. cannot wrap my head around functional programming languages.

On top of that, despite having been here in Japan now for more than 3 years (on
top of the 2 years I was here the first time), I still speak and read the
language poorly.

When faced with those facts, I tried to reconcile the amount of time I’d poured
into reading online with the little I felt I actually had to show for it. The
conclusion was that this was a result of having done the information equivalent
of snacking. I had stocked up big on sugary coated trivia but eaten little of
the more demanding intellectual vegetables. I can discuss the surface-level
minutiae of so many things but there’s almost no depth. This is not me fishing
for compliments. One can easily say that simply being aware of the minutiae
puts one ahead of so many others. But this isn’t a race, or if it is, it should
be with the people ahead, not the people behind.

I’m not trying to quit cold turkey. I think there is value in being aware of
the outlines of what is going on in the world. But I am trying to be more
selective. It means less time spent reading things from Twitter, less time
scrolling through RSS feeds, less time browsing blogs. Instead, more time
reading books, more time studying, more time learning new skills.

More time in meaningful engagement.
