excerpt: Do you ever confuse two people with similar names? How about we call this phenomenon 'connomming'?

**_This article [originally appeared][op] on one of my former blogs. I still have the problem described in this post and think about this phenomenon often._**

Is there a word for when you confuse people based on the fact they share either a first name or a last name? I propose a rather inelegant neologism of my own devising: _connomming_. I am a frequent connommer, only discovering well after the fact that I have been confusing, or indeed conflating, radically different people.

I became aware of two separate connomming instances today: one involving Richards and one involving Ians. For the record, and my own personal reference, I'm setting out who these people actually are.

The Richards are [Perle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Perle), [Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Clarke) and [Armitage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Armitage_(politician)):

- __Richard Perle__ is a neoconservative political scientist who has previously worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush;
- __Richard Clarke__ is a former member of the National Security Councils of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton; and
- __Richard Armitage__ is a former Assistant Secretary of Defense under Ronald Reagan and a former Deputy Secretary of State under George W. Bush.

The Ians are [Buruma](http://www.ianburuma.com/) and [Johnson](http://www.ian-johnson.com/):

- __Ian Buruma__ is a writer who grew up in the Netherlands and Japan and is fluent in Japanese (among other languages); and
- __Ian Johnson__ is a writer and journalist, fluent in Chinese (among other languages), who sometimes writes for the same publications as Ian Buruma.

Now back to your regularly scheduled programming.
