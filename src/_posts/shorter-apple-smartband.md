excerpt: "Here's a shorter argument for why Apple should make a smartband."

In March of last year I wrote [a(n overly long) post][op] about why Apple should make an Apple smartband. I stand by the argument laid out there but I'd like to have something more succinct I can point people to when discussing this issue.

[op]: https://articles.inqk.net/2018/03/08/apple-smartband.html "The post titled 'The Case for an Apple Smartband'"

So, without further ado, Apple should make a smartband because it would...

1. **...have better battery life**. The number one limitation with the Apple Watch is its battery life. The biggest battery cost? The display. Solution: drastically reduce the display.

2. **...cost less**. I'd say the number two limitation with the Apple Watch is the price. A smartband would be cheaper than a watch.

3. **...work better for payments**. Wristworn devices are great as a means of payment but payment terminals often assume payment using the right hand. Smartbands can be worn on either wrist.

4. **...be compatible with wearing mechanical watches**. A wristworn device like the Apple Watch works best when worn all the time. But wearing a smartwatch and a mechanical watch looks ridiculous.

As I said in the earlier post, think of an Apple smartband as being like the iPod Nano: a product that is more limited than its big brother but with massively broader appeal.
