# Hello World

Hello world. It's been [a while][aw].

It's been [even longer][el] if you count from my previous blog.

I’ve meant for a long time to start writing again but every time I’ve tried I’ve been frustrated at the tools available and begun designing my One True Blogging Engine. ([Rob][rh] calls it my ‘forever project’.)

[Micro.blog][mb] has changed things. I’m still not entirely happy with my current ‘stack’[^1] (as it were) but I have things I want to write _now_. I could do that through Micro.blog itself, of course, but I like to box things (as [Amanda][as] would say) and that extends to longer form writing and status updates.

Let’s see how this goes.
