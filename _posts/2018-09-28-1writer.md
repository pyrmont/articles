excerpt: Initial thoughts on switching to 1Writer.

One of the things that prompted me to start blogging again was finding a workflow that made it easy to post to [Jekyll][jekyll] from my phone. [Editorial][editorial] has been a key component of that. Together with [Working Copy][wc],  Editorial's powerful scripting support made it possible to take a plain Markdown document and with a few taps have a file formatted for Jekyll pushed to a remote Git repository (that then called a post-commit hook that updated my blog's local repository and rebuilt the site).

[editorial]: http://omz-software.com/editorial/

[wc]: https://workingcopyapp.com/

Unfortunately, Editorial no longer seems to be actively maintained.[^1] It's never been updated to support the larger displays on the iPhone X family of devices and, as a consequence, you have ugly letterboxing at the top and bottom of the screen when using on a larger phone.

Obviously that's gross and an alternative was required. I quickly settled on 1Writer. Key points for me: (1) supports larger screen phones; (2) powerful scripting support (in JavaScript no less, a language that I'm semi-competent in!); and (3) one-time payment.[^2] It's not as powerful as Editorial but it's robust enough to get the job pretty much done.

So far I've written custom [footnote][ggf], [reference link][ggrl] and [Jekyll frontmatter][ggjf] actions. Those links are to the respective GitHub Gists; I intend to share them through 1Writer's Action Directory once I'm a little more confident they're working correctly.

[^1]: It's a little bit unclear. The last update to the app was on [29 June 2017][bt] but [the developer][omz] is active on Twitter and there was a long delay between some of the previous releases so maybe an update is coming eventually.

[^2]: I'm a bit torn on this. On the one hand, subscription pricing means that developers have a financial incentive to keep their apps updated. On the other, it's really nice not to have _another_ recurring payment.

[^3]: Where it would, through the magic of a GitHub post commit hook, then be pushed down to my server, rendered and made available for all to see.

[^4]: Ideally 1Writer would allow actions to rename a file and move it. If it could do this, it'd be close to perfection.
