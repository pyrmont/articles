# Why Disclaim Copyright?

The short answer is that I believe copyright is too long and too restrictive.

In many countries, the copyright subsisting in a piece of work will last 50 to 100 years after the death of the author. Moreover, there will be severe restrictions on what other people can do with that work during the term of copyright.

My work is not that precious. I don't harbour any delusions that the articles in this blog are of a great benefit to humanity but I want to do whatever I can to replenish the cultural commons.
