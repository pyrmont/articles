# How to Use this Blog

Since this blog is organised a little differently to most, I thought it might be helpful to explain how it's designed to be used.

## The Reader

This blog is designed with the expectation that there are three types of reader:

1. the reader who comes from a search engine;
2. the reader who follows a shared link; and
3. the reader who reads updates in a feed reader.

Since none of these readers need the traditional front page, it has instead been replaced with a simple list of post titles ordered by date.

### Comments

There are no comments on this blog but feedback is nevertheless encouraged. I'd love to hear from you about any article. [Micro.blog][mba] is preferred but [Twitter][ta] is there if that's easier.

## The Writer

I write this blog purely to express my thoughts. I've previously found having a blog that displays full articles on a front page paralysing. I've worried about whether a particular post 'fits' within the focus of the site.

My hope is that by focusing on each article as a standalone piece, I'll feel empowered to write more, without concern for what the site is supposed to be 'about'. Fingers crossed.
